## 📝 Step-by-Step Instructions

### 1. Preparation

* **Warm the Engine:** Run the vehicle until it reaches full operating temperature (gauge near the middle). This helps oil drain faster and removes more contaminants.


* **Access:** Lift the vehicle and locate the oil filter housing and the oil pan drain plug on the passenger side.



### 2. Draining the Oil

* **Drain Plug:** Use a 14mm wrench to remove the drain plug. **Warning:** The oil will be hot.


* **Gasket:** Remove the old gasket from the drain plug. Always use a new gasket to prevent leaks.



### 3. Oil Filter Replacement

* **Remove Housing:** Use the Toyota oil filter wrench to loosen the housing.


* **Replace O-ring:** Remove the old O-ring and discard it. Lubricate the new O-ring with fresh engine oil before installation.


* **O-ring Placement:** Ensure the new O-ring sits in its **proper groove** (not on the threads or at the very bottom) to prevent crushing or leaking.


* **Insert Filter:** Place the new filter element into the housing and thread it back in by hand.



### 4. Torque Specifications

* **OIL FILTET DRAIN PLUG TORQUE** **9 ft-lbs** or **12.5 Nm**
* **OIL FILTER CAP TORQUE:** **18 ft-lbs** or **25 Nm**. Do not overtighten, as the housing is plastic.


* **DRAIN PLUG TORQUE:** **30 ft-lbs** or **40 Nm**.


* **Clean-up:** Use a rag or brake cleaner to wipe away any oil residue to ensure no drips remain.



### 5. Refilling and Checking

* **Add Oil:** Add 5.5 Liters (5.8 Quarts) of 0W-20 oil through the filler neck on the front passenger side.


* **Circulate:** Reinstall the fill cap and run the engine for a few seconds to fill the filter housing.


* **Verify Level:** Let the car sit for several minutes so oil drains back to the pan. Pull the dipstick, wipe it, reinsert it, and verify the oil level is at the "Full" mark.


* **Pro-tip:** Lubricate the dipstick O-ring with a bit of oil so it doesn't get stuck.
